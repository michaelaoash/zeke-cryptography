## RSA public-key encryption
## (This is not RSA public key encryption.)
## Encryption key N is a prime
## e and d chosen so that
#### GCD(e,N-1) = 1 
#### e*d % N-1 = 1
## Encrypt with C = P ** e % N
## Decrypt with C ** d % N
## Questions to ponder:
## Why is it useful for decryption to find d so that e*d % N-1 = 1
## How do we find d, the multiplicative inverse of e, mod N-1
